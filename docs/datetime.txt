Date/Time
=========

Time
----
MMIO.TIME stores the number of 2 second intervals since midnight. This value
wraps around upon reaching 43200 (the number of seconds in a day). Setting
MMIO.TIME to a value greater than or equal to 43200 is prohibited and leads to
undefined behavior.

Date
----
MMIO.DATE tracks the number of days since the epoch. The recommended epoch is
January 1st 1970, but this is not enforced.
