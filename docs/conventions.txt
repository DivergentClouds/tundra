Conventions

Calling Convention
------------------
1)  push arguments to stack
2a) push return address to stack
2b) jump to function
3)  run function body
4)  load return value into the `a` register
5a) pop return address into `b` register (if the function had no arguments and
  no local variables are on the stack, the register may be `pc`)
5b) drop arguments and local variables from stack if they exist
5c) jump to return address if not already done (in `b` register)

Notes
-----
- step 2 can be done via the `call` family of macros
- step 5 can be done via the `ret` family of macros
- registers are not preserved during function calls
