Storage
=======

Overview
--------
Storage I/O is done in blocks of 2048 bytes. A storage device contains 2^16
blocks.

Storage Access
--------------
To seek to a block in a storage device, use MMIO.SEEK_STORAGE. To load a block
from storage write to MMIO.LOAD_BLOCK with the memory address to write the data
from storage. To store a block in storage, write to MMIO.STORE_BLOCK with the
memory address of the data to write. Attempting to load or store a block above
memory address 0xf7f0 leads to undefined behavior, as the block would intersect
with the MMIO range.

Access Delay
------------
Storage access takes time, to check if the operation has completed, read 
MMIO.STORAGE_READY. Accessing storage mid-operation results in undefined
behavior.

Device Selection
----------------
Up to 4 storage devices may be attached, which may be selected from by writing
to MMIO.STORAGE_INDEX. By default, MMIO.STORAGE_INDEX is set to 0. To get the 
number of connected storage devices, read from MMIO.STORAGE_COUNT.  Attempting
to access a storage device that is not connected results in undefined behavior.
