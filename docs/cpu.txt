CPU
===

Clock
-----
The CPU has a clock speed of 5 MHz. On every clock cycle, if the program
counter is not in memory region 4, an internal cycle counter increments.
If timer interrupts are enabled, when the cycle counter overflows, trigger an
interrupt. For more information on interrupts, see interrupts.txt.

Registers
---------
Tundra has 7 16-bit registers, 4 of which are accessible at a time. Each
register has an id, which is used to represent it in machine code. Numbers in
the following diagram are in binary. 

  A  = 00
  B  = 01
  C  = 10
  PC = 11

The register ids A, B, and C refer to general purpose registers. By default
they refer to primary registers. To switch a register id to refer to a secondary
register, use the AND instruction with the same general purpose register id as
both arguments. To switch back to a primary register, use MOV with the same
register id as both arguments.

The program counter is incremented by 1 immediately after an instruction is
fetched.

Dereferencing
-------------
Registers in the source position of an instruction may be dereferenced.
Dereferencing a register will read the little-endian 16-bit value from memory at
the address contained in the register. Dereferencing the program counter will
increment it by 2. This happens after memory is read, but before the instruction
is executed.

Instruction Format
------------------
Each instruction is a single byte. The binary format of each instruction is as
follows.

  OOO WW D RR

Where O is the opcode, W is the destination register, R is the source register,
and D denotes whether the source register is dereferenced.

Opcodes
-------
The following diagram specifies the binary id of each opcode.

MOV = 000
STO = 001
ADD = 010
CMP = 011
ROT = 100
AND = 101
NOR = 110
XOR = 111

For information on the function of each opcode, see assembly.txt.
